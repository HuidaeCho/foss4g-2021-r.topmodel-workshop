Physically-based hydrologic modeling using GRASS GIS r.topmodel
===============================================================

This workshop will introduce r.topmodel (Cho 2000), the GRASS GIS module for a physically-based hydrologic model called TOPMODEL (Beven 1984).
r.topmodel is a C implementation of the original FORTRAN code by Beven and tightly integrated with GRASS GIS.
We will discuss step-by-step instructions for preparing input data for r.topmodel, running it, calibrating its model parameters, and, finally, post-processing the model outputs.
